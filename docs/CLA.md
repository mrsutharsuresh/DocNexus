# DocNexus Individual Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DocNexus ("We" or "Us").

This contributor agreement ("Agreement") documents the rights granted by contributors to Us. To make this really simple, this agreement effectively says:

1.  **You keep the copyright to your code.** You are just giving us a license to use it.
2.  **We can use your code.** You grant us a license to use, relicense, and redistribute your code as part of DocNexus. This is crucial for us to offer commercial licenses or defend the project legally.
3.  **It's your code.** You are confirming that you actually wrote the code you are contributing.

## 1. Definitions

"**You**" (or "**Your**") shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with Us. For legal entities, the entity making a contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor.

"**Contribution**" shall mean any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to Us for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by Us (the "**Work**"). For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to Us or our representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Us for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

**Why we need this:** This allows us to dual-license the project (e.g., offer a commercial license to enterprise customers who cannot use AGPL) without needing to ask every single contributor for permission every time.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of software distributed by Us a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted.

## 4. You Represent That:

1.  You are legally entitled to grant the above license.
2.  If Your employer(s) has rights to intellectual property that You create that includes Your Contributions, You represent that You have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that employer, that Your employer has waived such rights for Your Contributions to Us, or that Your employer has executed a separate Corporate CLA with Us.
3.  Your Contributions are Your original creation (see section 7 for submissions on behalf of others).

## 5. Support

You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions, except to the extent You desire to provide support. You may provide support for free, for a fee, or not at all. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, You provide Your Contributions on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

## 6. Commitment to Open Source

We promise that the Contribution shall always remain available under an OSI-approved open source license (currently AGPLv3). While we may also license the Work under other terms (e.g. commercial licenses), we will not withdraw the open source version.

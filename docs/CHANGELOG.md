# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.2.4] - 2026-01-09
### Added
- **Toast Notifications**: Replaced browser alerts with a modern, non-blocking toast notification system (Success/Error/Info) in the Extensions Marketplace.
- **Professional UI**: Updated "Extension Required" and "Uninstall Confirmation" modals to use a clean, solid "Professional Card" aesthetic (removing glassmorphism) with refined spacing and typography.
- **Hot-Reload**: Implemented true hot-reload for extensions. Installing an extension immediately activates it, and uninstalling immediately deactivates it without requiring a server restart.
- **Architectural Refactor**: Moved backend Editor logic (`save_document`) to a bundled plugin (`docnexus.plugins.editor`), validating the core-as-plugins architecture.

### Fixed
- **Uninstall Logic**: Fixed critical bug where uninstalling a plugin did not remove it from active memory, allowing it to function until restart. Now forces a module reload.
- **Extensions Page**: Fixed layout corruption (garbage code at bottom) and duplicate script logic that broke the "Disable" button interaction.
- **UI Spacing**: Tightened metrics for all application modals to be sleek and effective.

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-01-05

- **Testing**: Overhauled testing workflow. Switched to `pytest` (via `scripts/run_tests.py`), enabled single-command execution (`make test`), and centralized output to `tests/latest_results.log`.

### Security
- **PDF Export**: Implemented "Nuclear Safe Mode" that rigidly strips all external stylesheets and inline styles to prevent `xhtml2pdf` crashes on modern CSS variables.

### Fixed
- **Word Export**: Fixed `UnrecognizedImageError` by filtering SVG images and handling external image timeouts gracefully.
- **Word Export Content**: Fixed missing Table of Contents in exported files.
- **Word Export Navigation**: Fixed internal TOC links to correctly navigate to document sections.
- **Registry**: Resolved "Split-Brain" issue by unifying key classes in `docnexus.features.registry`.
- **UI**: Restored missing UI slots (`HEADER_RIGHT`, `EXPORT_MENU`).
- **Legacy Tests**: Updated legacy test suite (`test_loader`, `test_registry`) to align with the Phase 1 "Passive" Plugin Architecture (Duck Typing, Singleton Registry).

## [v1.2.3] - 2026-01-04
- **Pipeline Backbone**: Implemented `Pipeline` class to construct and execute sequences of `ALGORITHM` features.
- **Plugin Loader**: Updated `loader.py` to support `sys._MEIPASS`, enabling plugins bundled with PyInstaller to be correctly discovered at runtime.

### Added
- **Plugin Interface**: Added `get_features() -> List[Any]` to `PluginInterface` to support algorithm exposure.

### Fixed
- **App Initialization**: Resolved critical startup order issues in `app.py` to ensure plugins are loaded before feature manager refresh.

## [v1.2.2] - 2026-01-03

### Added
- **Phase 1: UI Slots System**: Implemented `PluginRegistry` support for injecting content into predefined UI slots (`HEADER_RIGHT`, `SIDEBAR_BOTTOM`, etc.).
- **Phase 1: React Integration**: Added support for mounting React components into UI slots using `plugin-loader.js`.
- **Phase 1: Split-Env Loader**: Implemented dual-mode plugin loading (development `plugins_dev` vs. production bundled plugins).

### Fixed
- **Critical Stability**: Fixed a major bug where double instantiation of the Flask application caused context processors (like `get_slots`) to be lost, leading to 500 Internal Server Errors.
- **Build System**: Improved robustness of `clean` operation to handle file locks on Windows (`shutil.rmtree` enhancement).
